## Requesting an API Key

If you'd like to do more tests and face an error for using the demo key, then you should request your own API Key for testing
1. Access https://api.nasa.gov/ for requesting a new API Key
2. Create a new environment on Postman and set this new key as the API KEY
3. Change the environment for testing using this new key instead of the demo key
