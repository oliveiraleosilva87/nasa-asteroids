# NASA Asteroids Data Engineering Project

This project explores NASA's Near Earth Object (NEO) API to build a **data engineering pipeline** around asteroid information.  
The goal is to practice and showcase skills in:
- Python development
- Data engineering workflows
- Project management with GitHub
- Documentation and communication

At this stage, the project is in its **early discovery phase**. The focus is on understanding the NASA API and designing the architecture for data ingestion, storage, and analysis.

---

## Objectives
- Learn how to interact with NASA's asteroid API
- Design a scalable data pipeline for ingestion and transformation
- Store and organize data for analysis
- Explore potential insights (e.g., asteroid frequency, size distribution, close approaches)

---

## Planned Tech Stack
- **Python** for data ingestion and processing
- **Pandas / PySpark** for transformations
- **SQL / Data Warehouse** (to be defined)
- **Visualization tools** (e.g., Jupyter, dashboards)
