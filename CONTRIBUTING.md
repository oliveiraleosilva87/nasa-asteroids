# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in this project!  
Right now, this is an early-stage personal project. As it grows, Iâ€™ll add more detailed contribution guidelines.  

For now:
- Please open an issue before submitting a pull request.
- Follow PEP8 style guidelines for Python code.
- Make sure new code includes tests where possible.
